## How to Use System Prompts

### Understanding System Prompts

System prompts are instructions given to AI models that define their behavior, personality, capabilities, and constraints. They are typically hidden from end users but significantly influence how the AI responds.

### Use Cases

1. **Research**: Study how different AI systems are configured
2. **Education**: Learn prompt engineering techniques
3. **Development**: Understand AI behavior for integration
4. **Analysis**: Compare approaches across different AI providers

### Best Practices

- **Respect Copyright**: All content is for educational/research use only
- **Verify Sources**: Check original sources when available
- **Understand Context**: System prompts may be version-specific
- **Don't Misuse**: Don't use prompts to bypass safety measures
