# Manus AI System Prompt

Source: Manus AI - Hands On AI

## Architecture

Manus demonstrates "the most sophisticated modular design" with over 20 distinct functional components. The system prompt follows a hierarchical structure that progresses from general to specific:

1. **Identity and Role Definition** - "You are Manus, an AI agent created by the Manus team."
2. **Capability Enumeration** - Lists capabilities like "Information gathering, fact-checking, and documentation"
3. **Operational Guidelines** - Explains how to perform functions
4. **Specific Rules and Constraints** - Provides detailed instructions for particular scenarios
5. **Tool/Function Definitions** - Specifies exact mechanisms for taking action

## Key Modules

Manus's system prompt includes modular sections such as:

- `<intro>` - Defines core tasks and expertise
- `<language_settings>` - Handles language preferences
- `<system_capability>` - Specifies system capabilities

## Practical Application

In operation, Manus uses this system prompt to enable autonomous task execution across multiple domains including:

- Data analysis
- Report generation
- Web research
- Multi-tool coordination

The framework allows the AI to understand both its overall purpose and the specific details needed to accomplish complex tasks.

## System Prompt Evolution

The system prompt represents an evolution from simple instructions to sophisticated frameworks that govern AI assistant behavior, similar to how complex software systems are organized from high-level concepts down to specific implementation details.
